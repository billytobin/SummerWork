Lighter Background, darker text

less text, focus on punchline

for each grpah, just try to have to point you are tyring to display

in introduction, break it down into bullet points
	make it easier to read for non-comp sci people maybe

small code snippet that provides example of overloaded method and a little bit of an explanation

look at overloaded methods in repos then use those as an example and be like hey these are mission critical and we need to know when to use the right one

then in intro start introducin issues with 

justifying the text

figure 1 and figure 2

boxes below need to have a little explanation

alot of the stuff i have i can use bullet points for

having 4 graphs showing 4 different trends

maybe another one is as lines of code increases do overloaded methods also inncrease

flow diagram that visualizes the pipeline that analyzes

if you have flow diagram that will fill up spacew

havehaving a bullet that references that diagram in the method seciton

rename method section to Methodology

aggregated graphs is better

we do not need to add more graphs for now

big things:

regorganize text in bullet 

withing string impenetaion of java, there is a substring method that is overloaded
use this as example
