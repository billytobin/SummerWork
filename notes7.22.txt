python analyzeManyVersions.py 6

python cloneToDelta.py 14

focus on having fine grained

rn we have 4 points

make it so i can input the num of points as a configurable thing on pipelin/cmd

use a delta to be a graph

second:

we have to look at size of repo?

comparing two points in time

if we say that num of overloaded metthods increased, we might say its because the developers wanted to do it like that, or it is becuase the code in general has increased

size of repo matters

we may end up seeing some negatives

even if we dont it would still be good to see it

for the future another indicator is the number of classes/methods/etc implemented

if repo doesnt change but methods go down, that would be a good thing

relation of growth vs delta

the java prgm should output data

do the delta comparison of the

there are many ways to do the delta in python

if we have an array of these json

at each instance of the anlaysis carry on the delta.
