formalize and configurize the code for a github repositry\

so first focus on answering research questions that we can answer with current data.

when i start working on posters, write down all of research questions that we want to ask

like maybe is there a correlation between overloaded methods and contributors

might be a good way to organize the poster

put a link to the github

what might be cool is create a qr code to go to github

the story that I want to use to sell the idea

very high level comment is presenting whta overloaded methods are, the challenges that come with it, and then talk about the questions

then go into the questions one by one

question-hypothesis-results for each question

try to generalize 50-100 results to make graphs and conclusions

aggragated grpahs accross multiple projects

for each question we should have a graph to represent what we learn

most of summer was building this framework/infrastructure

maybe try to show the pipeline of how I built this

target 50 or so repositories
