make documents about how ot run the graphs, how to run program, and what i did over the summer

make 5-6 correlations

look at past notes to re organize research questions in a table and we can think about it like what kind of correlations are we looking for

now we need to focus on hypothesis we have

we are going to have individual research questions that we will inverstigate with data we have

resrarch conf that gulzar set up

the way that it should work is that i have to build a pipeline of all the programs, end-to-end

build paper with 50 projects, then eventually work our way up to the 1000

on my end, make a pipeline that takes in a list of projects, and outputs 10 graphs or csv files.

make my pipeline, and then send to gulzar so his student replaces api with his thing

if my tool is a python executable, then the executable could tak e a flag followed by a path to directory. ouptut data will.

dont worry about other people using my tool, bcuz rn the goal is to have analysis ready, rn we need to make sure its extensible for th ecluster to run it

make sure its aurmotated and configurable

instead of saying

we can start at current at go back

in a snapshot look at num of overloaded methods vs contributors

taditionally people use loc, but lets use loc and then if we see awkward outcomes then we can see if it makes sense to do num of methods

maybe start looking at specific method going out

num of om added and num of overm deleted

for future:?
one thing may be methods with 1 characther difference
