notes 7/15/21

one thing we can add is

take the progression and we see how the num is changing

at a certain commit number, keep the source code

all we need is commit number

so put the commit number/identifying info inn the JSON

just the url and github ID and keep hash in JSON

within python there is a nice graph and chart library matplotlib

make those charts and plots

look into methods added into overloaded methods list and methods lost

try to make my script as configurable as possible
