start in a simple metric

the simplest metrics
	loc

normalize things across projects

we should start for the most simplest thing

per commit thing calculate num of overloaded methods and then the size of project

we always write this section on validity of study

why outcomes that we have inferred might be incorrect

correlation between num of overloaded methods and lines of code

the repo may be growing but we wont see change of percentages

we can focus on making a very brief report or presentation

create a story with the presentation

generalize the results of the survey

expand the breadth of the study

start creating scripts that are automatic that we can put on the cluster

have an outline of the poster and make the scaffolding for the script that we would send to the cluster.
