conference in late january and early febraury

mining software repos .... MSR - January 20th

missing a narrative of paper

how do combine our different insights to create a story

what do we want to sell

make 5-6 research questions that we have the data to answer

-how prevelent
-do people use it
-what is perceptoin among devs

try ot write paper first and then come back and maybe do user study etc.

manual analysis of projects .. github issues .. see if issues correlate to overloadness

8 pages

for me:

congregate all of the analysis in a google folder with caption and clear explanation of each

*** consolodited doc of all of our results

*** research questions

*** students usually focus on methodology and litle bit of results

options: 10 page full paper  or 4 page short paper

*** make snalysis ready for github

*** first do consolidation of results
